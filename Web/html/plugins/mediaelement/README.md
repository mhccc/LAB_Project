## Introduction

_MediaElementPlayer: HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` player_

A complete HTML/CSS audio/video player built on top `MediaElement.js` and `jQuery`. Many great HTML5 players have a completely separate Flash UI in fallback mode, but MediaElementPlayer.js uses the same HTML/CSS for all players.

`MediaElement.js` is a set of custom Flash plugins that mimic the HTML5 MediaElement API for browsers that don't support HTML5 or don't support the media codecs you're using. 
Instead of using Flash as a _fallback_, Flash is used to make the browser seem HTML5 compliant and enable codecs like H.264 (via Flash) on all browsers.

<a id="new-features"></a>
## * What's New on `MediaElement.js` version 3.0

* Introduction of `Renderers`, pluggable code that allows the introduction of new media formats in an easier way.

* Refactor code in `ES2015` notation and added [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/johndyer/mediaelement) and [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/github/johndyer/mediaelement) support

* Ability to play Facebook, SoundCloud, M(PEG)-DASH using [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) for native support and [dash.as](https://github.com/castlabs/dashas) for Flash fallback.

* Code completely documented using [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) notation.

* Updated styles for control bar.

* Introduction of BEM naming convention for player classes, and backward compatibility with "legacy" stylesheet.

* Addition of native HLS using [hls.js](https://github.com/dailymotion/hls.js) library.

* Updated player for Vimeo by removing the use of `Froogaloop` and integrating the new [Player API](https://github.com/vimeo/player.js).
 
* Removed Silverlight shim, as well as IE8 and older browsers support.

* Integration of [JSLint](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint) to ensure code quality and better error checking for development.

<a id="migration"></a>
## * IMPORTANT: Migrating from `2.x` to `3.x` version

In order to successfully install `3.x` in an existing setup, you must consider the following guidelines:

1. If your installation relies on the legacy player classes (i.e., `mejs-player`, `mejs-container`, etc.), you **must** set up the proper namespace. In `2.x`, the default namespace is `mejs-` but now is `mejs__`. In order to set up a new namespace (or the legacy one), use the `classPrefix` configuration, and make sure you use the `mediaelementplayer-legacy` stylesheet provided in the `/build/` folder.

2. You **must** set up now the path for the Flash shims if they are not in the same folder as the JS files. To do this, set the path via the `pluginPath` configuration. In the same topic, if you need to support browsers with Javascript disabled, you **must** reference the correct Flash shim, since in `2.x` there was only a single Flash shim and in `3.x` it was split to target specific media types. Check the [Browsers with JavaScript disabled](docs/installation.md#disabled-javascript) section for more details.
 
3. If you need to force the Flash shim, the way to do it in `3.x` version is to use the `renderers` configuration and list them in an array.

4. `pluginType` was removed to favor `rendererName`. If you rely on that element, just create conditionals based on the renderer ID (all listed [here](docs/usage.md#renderers-list)). For example:

```javascript
$('video, audio').mediaelementplayer({
        // Configuration
        success: function(media) {
                var isNative = media.rendererName.match(/html5|native/);
                
                var isYoutube = media.rendererName.match(/youtube/);
                
                // etc.
        }
});
```

mp3 | audio/mp3 | Please visit http://caniuse.com/#feat=mp3 for comprehensive information
ogg/ogv | audio/ogg, audio/oga, video/ogg | Please visit http://caniuse.com/#search=ogg for comprehensive information

m3u8 | application/x-mpegURL, vnd.apple.mpegURL, audio/mpegURL, audio/hls, video/hls | Safari and iOS (native); browsers that support MSE through `hls.js` library; rest of the browsers that support `Flash` (version 10 or later)
mpd | application/dash+xml | Browsers that support MSE through `dash.js` library; rest of the browsers that support `Flash` (version 10 or later)
flv | video/flv | Browsers that support MSE through `flv.js` library; rest of the browsers that support `Flash` (version 10 or later)
rtmp | video/mp4, video/rtmp, audio/rtmp, rtmp/mp4, audio/mp4 | All browsers that support `Flash` (version 10 or later)
youtube | video/youtube, video/x-youtube | All browsers that support `window.postMessage`; Flash deprecated.
vimeo | video/vimeo, video/x-vimeo | All browsers that support `iframe` tag and HTML5
facebook | video/facebook, video/x-facebook | All browsers that support `iframe` tag and HTML5
dailymotion | video/dailymotion, video/x-dailymotion | All browsers that support `iframe` tag and HTML5
soundcloud | video/soundcloud, video/x-soundcloud | All browsers that support `iframe` tag and HTML5

**Notes** 
* Support for `wmv` and `wma` has been dropped since most of the major players are not supporting it as well.
* `ogg` formats wonâ€™t play consistently in all browsers so it is strongly recommended a MP3 fallback for audio, or MP4 for video.
* `wav` formats will only play on Browsers that support it natively since there is currently no Flash fallback to allow them to play in other browsers.
